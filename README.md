## Tech Stack

For this project, we will be using Android Studio with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, coupled with Firebase.

## App Funcionality

An alcoholic drink tracker app allows users to estimate their Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) by inputting details such as the number and type of drinks consumed, as well as other factors like food intake. The app will use this information to calculate an estimated BAC, helping users monitor their alcohol consumption and make informed decisions about their drinking. By taking into account variables like drink type and food consumption, the app aims to provide more accurate BAC estimates for responsible and safe drinking. Moreover, you can take a look at your past drinking history as a reference to the different types of alcohol you have consumed. The app will observe all data variables each night and algorithmically generate a standardized “score” (represented by icon/number) so the user can easily track progress based on one simple variable that represents all data.

## User Roles

User will track their alcohol content throughout the night and have options to:
<ol>
  <li>Log drinks</li>
  <li>Manually add custom drinks to the database</li>
  <li>Save common drinks in a separate personal user “common drinks” database</li>
  <li>View current and past alcohol consumption data (BAC, amount of drinks, types of drinks consumed, etc.)</li>
  <li>View generalized “score” based on all data variables that will be displayed in fun/colorful icon/message</li>
</ol>

## Installation 
You will find a zip folder in our release tag named "First Release". Inside is an APK to use the app. Download the file and extract the apk. The APK can then be moved to an Android device and installed. Currently, our oldest version tested is Android 12, thus we cannot confirm if BACtrack works on any previous versions.
