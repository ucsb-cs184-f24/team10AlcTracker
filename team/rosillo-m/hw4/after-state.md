After my contributions have been made, I have been able to organize our documentation inp ur repository by updating and adding files, and adding the first drafts of our DESIGN and MANUAL - documents that are very important for us teh developers, stakeholders and users.


Below, you can find screenshots of my additions (which can be compared to the before state in this same folder).
