# Contributions:

I implemented a feature of the drink drop-down where the user can enter in their own custom drink that gets stored in the drop-down menu. The custom drink stores a name (displayed) and alcohol weight which is used to recalculate their BAC when selected. The user can also delete the newly added drink from the menu.

- Closed Issue#49 and Issue #51
- See DrinkMenu_WithCustomButton.png and AddCustomDrinkMenu.png

See customDrink branch for code changes.
