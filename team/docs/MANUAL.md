# BACtrack Manual

## Product Purpose
BACtrack is an Android mobile application designed to help individuals drink responsibly and stay safe. Its purpose is to provide users with a reliable tool to monitor and manage their alcohol consumption. By tracking the number and types of alcoholic drinks consumed, alongside storing personal information like weight and sex, BACtrack estimates the user’s Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) in real-time. It also offers insights into how users may feel based on their BAC levels.

BACtrack promotes health-conscious drinking habits by enabling users to analyze and understand their consumption patterns through visual BAC representations and historical data tracking. It simplifies the process of logging drinks—even without actively using the app—ensuring ease of use in social settings. Additionally, the app prioritizes safety by maintaining critical emergency contact information.

Designed with an intuitive and user-friendly interface, BACtrack is accessible to all users, empowering them to make informed decisions and adopt safer drinking practices.
