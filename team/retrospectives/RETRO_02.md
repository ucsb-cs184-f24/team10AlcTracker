# Date of Retrospective: 11/10/24

* Led by: Elijah Anderson
* Present: Mariana Rosillo, Ivan Hernandez, Maya Rosembaum, Elijah Anderson, Madison Long, Konark Vinod
* Absent: None

## Action item

* a goal: Improve group communications as well as team progress, 
* a change:  All team members must have a detailed description of exactly what they will have down and when they will have it done by posting. This will aid team members who are waiting for another user story to be complete
* a measurement: We will see if work progress continues at a faster pace and check in to determine if any team members are still waiting for another student to complete their issue before they can proceed. 

  # outcome:
  Some improved attendance/better communication still needs work though, some students constantly use being busy as an excuse to completely avoid contributing to deliverables. - (Retro Leader)

Our experiment had been (so far) somewhat a success. With a more cohesive work flow established now that everyone is absolutely clear what they are supposed to be working on
