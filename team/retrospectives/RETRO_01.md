* Led by: Madison Long
* Present: Mariana Rosillo, Ivan Hernandez, Maya Rosembaum, Elijah Anderson, Madison Long
* Absent: Konark Vinod

## Action item

* a goal: Start holding formal planning meetings to discuss what will be required of us from each step of development even if we have not actually started our deliverable components
* a change: We want to have more meetings outside of class to determine what direction to take as we move toward our MVP
* a measurement: We will see if the change helped us achieve the goal if we have at some extra steps on how to move toward our MVP

  # outcome:
  Since our retro, we have had increased attendance, more engagement and better group progress. The diffrence is quite frankly shocking. - Madison, (Retro Leader)

Our experiment had been (so far) quite a successs. With more frequent check ins, better team communication and more group work completed.
