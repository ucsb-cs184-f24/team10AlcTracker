# Contributions 
For HW04, I have discussed with my team and am responsible for the Profile section of the app. Additionally, I've been assigned to enhance the UI/UX of the homepage, aiming to make it more visually appealing. I'm focused on bringing a fresh look to the project while collaborating closely with the backend team to ensure a cohesive design.

The team initially created a default home page, but since last week, I have been working on enhancing its UI/UX style. Iâ€™ve already pushed some substantial design contributions to our Git repository. Moving forward, I plan to extend this updated UX across the entire app for a cohesive user experience.
