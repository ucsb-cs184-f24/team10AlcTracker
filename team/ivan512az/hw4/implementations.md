Here are the implementations I've added since my last report:

Following my implementation, the app now features:

•An improved sign-up page with the app logo and integrated sign-up options for Google and GitHub.

•An enhanced, interactive user interface to provide a more engaging experience once users are logged in.

•	A visually appealing background design that resembles beer, incorporating colors and bubbles to align with the app’s theme.

Additionally, we’ve prioritized making the app intuitive and easy to navigate, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience for our users.

With my design contributions, I am addressing the critical challenge of creating a visually appealing and user-friendly app. Usability and design are two of the most important aspects of any successful application, and our team is committed to excelling in both.

For our group, UI design is particularly important because our app is designed for college students who want to drink responsibly. Understanding that navigating an app under the influence can be challenging, we are focused on creating a clean, intuitive, and easy-to-use interface.

Additionally, we aim to distinguish our app from competitors by incorporating innovative technological features and ideas, ensuring it provides a superior and engaging user experience.
