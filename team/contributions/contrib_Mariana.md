## Is the contributions graph accurate? 

No, the contributions graph is not entirely accurate. There were instances where I worked on multiple tasks and committed all changes at once, which might not reflect the extent of my contributions. Additionally, some of my commits are missing from the graph.

I also noticed inaccuracies in the contributions graph for other team members. For example, Ivan Hernandez’s graph shows only one commit (as of the last check), despite his significant work on the UI/UX design of the app.
