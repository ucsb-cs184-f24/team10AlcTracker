## Graph

Overall, the graph is not accurate. For one, it does not take into account ideas we have gotten, such as our name from Maya or the testing Konark did of another groups project. Additionally, I moved much of much of Ivan's work to my branches when fixing merge conflicts. Thus, my effort is overstated while his is uderstated. It gives the apperance of a lopsided participation but that cannot be farther from the truth.
