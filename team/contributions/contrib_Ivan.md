## Is the contributions graph accurate? 

No, from the beginning of the course, my GitHub account had issues being enrolled in the course repository. I worked with two TAs and ultimately resolved this issue.

However, for some reason, my contributions are not reflected on the GitHub contribution graph. My team members can vouch for all the contributions I made to the app.
